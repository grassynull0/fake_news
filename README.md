# Fake News Classification with a Flask Front End
----
#### by Ben Inoyatov

### Introduction
---
- Fake news has become a buzzword in these Digital Revolution days. With the power of the internet, *anyone* can have their voice heard. While this idea has led to the exponential growth of real, trustworthy data it has also led to the rise of 'fake' data. Bots, trolls, and fake user accounts mask themselves seemlesly in the guise of the internet. It is more important now than ever before that we maintain a ground-truth of what the internet can be. This project focuses on analyzing twenty thousand+ articles that were deemed 'fake' or not. In addition to tuning a model, there is also a front end Flask application where a user can enter a URL link to an article and the application will output whether it deems the article fake. 
- Libraries used: ```pandas | numpy | matplotlib | scikitlearn | NLTK | Flask```

Notebooks to refer to:
- For EDA and csv compilation refer to: ```eda_and_cleaning.ipynb```
- For the model process along with visualizations refer to: ```NLP_modeling.ipynb```
